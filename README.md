# Vue-intro App
Sample application for the JSAlpharetta Meetup

This application was built using the CDN and a simple .html file to showcase some of Vue's basic features such as directives, data binding, filters and methods on day 1 of our Vue.js Track. 

The application can be run on JSBin, JSFiddle or any other online/offline editor of your choice.
